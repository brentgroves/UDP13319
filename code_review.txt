ProcessAssemblyCounters.js - Program that processes the output that results from the 
execution of the M208 command.

Case 1:
1. Cycle completes and all counters have been incremented, 
2. program jumps to NST1.
3. OTLM is executed and a tool life condition was found.
4. At this point M208 has not yet recorded the latest tool counter increments.
5. The tool setter changes the tool and resets the counter to 0.
6. The program is reset and OTLM is executed with no alarms.
7. A pallet change occurs and the tool counter reader subroutine, OCOM1.SSB, is ran.
8. This function, ProcessAssemblyCounters(),is processed and finds the tool counter equal to 0. 
9. The running total IS incremented.
10. The tool life is recorded.

Case 2:
1. Before the cycle completes the tool setter changes the tool.
2. The tool setter resets the counter to 0.
3. The tool setter starts the program from where he stopped it probably at an M01 instruction.
4. The tool counter is incremented.
5. The cycle completes and the program jumps to instruction NST1.
6. Subroutine OTLM.SSB executes without alarms.
7. A pallet change occurs and the tool counter subroutine, OCOM1.SSB, is ran.
8. This function, ProcessAssemblyCounters(), is processed and finds the tool counter equal to the Increment_By value.
9. We do NOT increment RunningTotal.
10. The tool life is recorded.

Case 3: (Non-Aluminum job)
1. The tool setter examines the tool assembly and decides not to change the tooling.
2. The tool setter rolls back the tool counter. 
3. This function, ProcessAssemblyCounters(), is executed and the RunningTotal is incremented.

Case 4: (Aluminum jobs)
1. The tool setter examines the tool assembly and decides not to change the tooling.
2. The tool setter increase the tool life in OTLM.SSB.
3. This function, ProcessAssemblyCounters(), is executed and the RunningTotal is incremented.
